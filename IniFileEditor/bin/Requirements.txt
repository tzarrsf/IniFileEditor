Within the setup.ini file are keys like this:
(begin example)
[connect1]
reg=REG5
site=8601
host=10.2.2.33
port=8990
timeout=0

[connect2]
reg=reg2
site=7042
host=localhost
port=8991
timeout=3000
(end example)

connect1 is the JPOS data server
connect2 is the resilient mode server

We only want to change host=X.X.X.X under the connect1 to have a new entry.
It needs to work for an IP address or host name scenario.
The old file should be backed up prior to changes.
